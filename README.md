This is built from https://github.com/facebook/react at 23ab30ff873fba816129cafa0c40112dd2ee990d
with ReactTestUtils added to React.addons as per [this post](http://myshareoftech.com/2013/12/unit-testing-react-dot-js-with-jasmine-and-karma.html)

An npm package to get you immediate access to [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/),
without also requiring the JSX transformer. This is especially useful for cases where you
want to [`browserify`](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) your module using
`React`.
